## 1. Project Title
Basic Staking Platform in Clarity

## 2. Project Description
This is a minimalistic staking smart contract written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain.  
It allows users to stake STX tokens into the contract and withdraw them later.  
The contract maintains each user's staking balance and the total amount staked in the platform.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a lightweight and secure foundation for staking systems on Stacks,  
serving as a base for more complex staking platforms with rewards, penalties, and governance features.

## 4. Future Scope
- Implement reward distribution for stakers.
- Add lock-in periods for stakes.
- Introduce governance mechanisms for managing staking rules.
- Provide an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) based reward system.
- Integrate with a front-end DApp for easy interaction.
